### This repository contains photos of apparels, mainly Bottom Wear and Top Wear. Main aim is to get hands on practice of how an image classfication works and what internally things are happning.

#### Main aim is to classfiy bottom and top wear for a business use case. The data is manually gathered and annotate. 

### I have used Simple CNN algorithm and the results are as follows: 

Epoch 1/3
24/24 [==============================] - 12s 480ms/step - loss: 0.8016 - accuracy: 0.7237 - val_loss: 0.2586 - val_accuracy: 0.9301

Epoch 2/3
24/24 [==============================] - 11s 472ms/step - loss: 0.2645 - accuracy: 0.8922 - val_loss: 0.1218 - val_accuracy: 0.9624

Epoch 3/3
24/24 [==============================] - 11s 470ms/step - loss: 0.1753 - accuracy: 0.9407 - val_loss: 0.1260 - val_accuracy: 0.9624

#### This is my first project regarding Image classification.
